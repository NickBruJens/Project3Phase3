# A* - Project 3 phase 3, ENPM661
 
The project was created for Project 3 phase3 as part of ENPM661- Planning for Autonomous Robots at University of Maryland, College park

The obstacles were defined as shown in the problem statement. 

The Project contains 4 files
* Proj3Phase3.py  - This is the A* algorthim
* ReadMe.txt - what you are reading now
* Proj3Phase3video.mp4 - a video of the algorthim
* path.csv - path of points and directions of travel

## Dependencies to run the code. 


* Python Version 3
* numpy Version 1.16.2
* matplotlib Version 3.0.3

## User Inputs
`
Start Point and angle
